# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix.
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
1. Define the package as scipy.linalg import lu.
2. Get input from user and print L and U matrix by 'print'
3. Define a package as "from scipy.linalg import lu_factor lu_solve" and create the
variable as "x" include the package in that variable.
4. print the variable 'X' 
## Program:
```python
Program to find the rank of a matrix.

import numpy as np
a=([[5,-3,-10],[2,2,-3],[-3,-1,5]])
rank=np.linalg.matrix_rank(a)
print(rank)
```
## Output:

## Result:
 The rank for the given matrix is successfully solved by  using a python program.
